# Behaviour Tree System

An explanation of **how behviour trees work** can be found in [WhatIsABehaviourTree.md](./BehaviourTreeStructure/WhatIsABehaviourTree.md)

I've suggested a **[list of criteria](./BehaviourTreeStructure/CoveredGradingCriteria.md) from the course**, that I believe this system covers

All of my **code** for the system can be found [here](./BehaviourTreeStructure/Code/) and an [example implementation](./BehaviourTreeStructure/DemoTree.cs) of the system here 

[Here](./BehaviourTreeStructure/ClassDiagram.md)'s a **class diagram** over the foundamental classes
